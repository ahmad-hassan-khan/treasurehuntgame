# treasurehuntgame
This is a simple game i created while learning pyhton 
If you are a begineer and try to make a game then create one like this ok 
I recently started learning python so i developed it
This is one of the simple game if you have knowledge about the conditions in pyhton like if and elif you can easily create game like this 
Basocally First i print out use print() that is welcome to treasure island
Then i Provide user two options to choose one left and other the right one 
and at last i use .lower() that will make all the letter size that user ha typed into lower case
so if user picks left then the output will be fall into a hole game over
and if it picks right by typing it then simply it will again show two options like swim or wait
then if the user picks the swim option then output will be attacked by trout
otherwise if it picks wait then the next option will display that is which door
so at that point there are three doors in which one user have to pick
one is blur other is red and the last one is yellow
so if it picks blue one then the output will be eaten by beasts game over
if picks red then burned by fire .game over
and if pick yellow then you win 
or if user type some random keywords like safdaf so then game over which is the last else statment i written
